# Why-ERC-4626-Became-the-Standard-for-DeFi-Vaults

## The Problem With DeFi Vaults Before ERC-4626

Before ERC-4626, DeFi vaults had no shared standard. Every protocol implemented its own vault logic, which resulted in inconsistent behavior across the ecosystem.

Deposit and withdrawal flows differed from protocol to protocol, yield accounting was handled in different ways, and integrations were often fragile. The more custom code a vault required, the higher the risk of bugs, exploits, and accounting errors.

For users, vaults were confusing to use. For developers and institutions, the technical and operational risk made vaults difficult to scale safely.

## What Is ERC-4626 (Simple Explanation)

ERC-4626 is a standard for **tokenized vaults** on Ethereum.

In simple terms, it standardizes how vaults accept deposits, issue shares, calculate value, and handle withdrawals. By defining a common interface, ERC-4626 ensures that all compliant vaults behave in a predictable and consistent way.

Because of this, ERC-4626 has effectively become the **DeFi vault standard** for tokenized vaults across the ecosystem.

## Why ERC-4626 Was a Turning Point for DeFi Vaults

ERC-4626 fundamentally changed how vaults are built and adopted.

Developers no longer need to reinvent core vault logic, making it easier to build vaults correctly. Users can rely on consistent behavior across different protocols, while integrations become simpler and more reliable.

Most importantly, standardization allows vaults to scale across chains and ecosystems. ERC-4626 paved the way for what is now widely referred to as the **Vault Era** in DeFi.

## How ERC-4626 Powers Concrete Vaults

Concrete vaults are built directly on top of the ERC-4626 standard.

This enables a consistent deposit and withdrawal experience, transparent share accounting, and easier auditing and monitoring. Following a standardized interface also allows Concrete vaults to integrate seamlessly across DeFi and support safer strategy upgrades.

ERC-4626 serves as the foundation for Concrete’s institutional-grade vault infrastructure.

## ctASSETs as ERC-4626 Vault Shares

When users deposit into a Concrete vault, they receive **ctASSETs**.

ctASSETs are ERC-4626–compliant vault shares that represent a user’s proportional ownership of the vault and its underlying assets. Any yield generated by the vault is reflected directly in the value of the ctASSET.

There is no need for manual claiming or position management—the accounting is handled entirely by the vault.

## How ERC-4626 Enables One-Click DeFi on Concrete

Because vault behavior is standardized, Concrete can abstract away all strategy complexity from the user.

Instead of managing multiple positions or farming strategies manually, users make a single deposit. Compounding, rebalancing, and strategy execution happen automatically inside the vault.

ERC-4626 is what allows Concrete to deliver **one-click access to managed DeFi** strategies and power a true **one-click DeFi** experience.

## Why ERC-4626 Makes Concrete Institutional-Grade

Institutions require predictability, transparency, and clear risk structures when engaging with DeFi.

ERC-4626 provides standardized vault interfaces, clear accounting, and simplified reporting, making risk assessment and operational oversight easier. This reduces operational risk and aligns vault behavior with familiar fund-like structures.

These properties make Concrete vaults well-suited for **institutional DeFi**, functioning more like **on-chain funds** than experimental DeFi products.
